# Space-travel-website
 
 An interactive and immersive space travel website built using HTML, CSS, and Js, built with the collaboration of Kevin Powell and scrimba. The site has 4 pages- the main page with an explore button that leads to the destination page - which has tabs for the Moon, Mars, Titan, Europa, and the Carina nebula which was recently discovered by the James Webb space telescope. The third page has a description of various crew members that includes dots for navigation. The last page is named technology and consists of the various space vehicles that are necessary to carry out the space mission.
This project took a total of 8 days to build from start to completion and the live site is uploaded to netlify as well, the link for which is provided below.
